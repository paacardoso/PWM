# PWM
Personal Work Manager

## Description
- PWM (Personal Work Manager), is a day-to-day management application where one can store several informations about it's own
  life projects.
  The main element in this application is the project. The project can relate with tasks, alerts, notes and work sessions.
  This way, and using this information, one can execute all the necessary work that a project demands.
  All work is related to one resource, so login is always required. This way PWM can trace all actions made within the project.
  This include not only changes to the project, but also, logging the time spent within each project's task.


## Future implementations

  Management of all accounts of a person, including the possibility of home banking lists text parsing.
- Work Sessions Manager
  Windows App Agent that will manage all the work made in a persons computer.
